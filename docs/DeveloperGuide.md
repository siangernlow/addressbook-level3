--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



**VirusTracker** is a **desktop app** for generating statistics for Covid-19, optimized for use via a **Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a **Graphical User Interface** (GUI).
It is mainly targeted towards healthcare officials who are handling large amounts of data due to the pandemic.
VirusTracker aims to provide a faster and quicker alternative to common statistical programs.

## **Preface**

Welcome to the Developer Guide on VirusTracker.

This guide will guide you through how VirusTracker was designed, implemented and tested. 

VirusTracker works with three main entities:
* People
* Locations
* Visits

A person refers to any person who may be at risk from Covid-19. VirusTracker stores data about the Id, name, address, phone number and email of each person.
Furthermore, the infection and quarantine statuses of each person are stored within VirusTracker. 

A location refers to any location which are open for visiting. VirusTracker stores the Id, name and address of each location.

A visit refers to when a person visits a location on a given date. VirusTracker stores the date and data of the person and location involved in the Visit.

VirusTracker would then be able to generate useful information based off the data that is input into the system.

While VirusTracker is created with the purpose of processing data based on Covid-19, VirusTracker can also monitor other
future epidemics or pandemics.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


## **Using this guide**

This Developer Guide is to be used as a reference for developers who want to maintain and expand on the existing VirusTracker code base.
 
As there are multiple components interacting with each other given any user actions, it is recommended that you use this guide alongside experimentation with the program itself.
You may wish to trace an execution path using one of the following commands:

   * **`list l/people`** : Lists all people.

   * **`addLocation`**`idl/L123A n/NTU a/50 Nanyang Ave, 639798` : Adds a location named `NTU` to the VirusTracker.

   * **`deletePerson`**`3` : Deletes the 3rd person shown in the current list.

   * **`clear`** : Deletes all entries from VirusTracker.
   
You might also find the sequence diagrams under [`Implementation`](#implementation) helpful in the tracing process.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


## **Notations**

Here are a few notations which used in this Developer Guide. Each notation has a different meaning to help you understand the guide better.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info"> 

:information_source: **Note:**

Presents information which are helpful to take note about. 

</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:**

Good to learn, but not necessary to know.

</div>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



## **Setting up, getting started**

Refer to the guide [_Setting up and getting started_](SettingUp.md).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


## **Design**

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T13-1/tp/tree/master/docs/diagrams) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>



**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

![Class Diagram of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)



**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `deletePerson 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

The sections below give more details of each component.



### UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T13-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

With reference to the diagram above, the UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `LocationListPanel`, `VisitListPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.



### Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

With reference to the diagram above, this section explains the structure of the logic component:
1. `Logic` uses the `VirusTrackerParser` class to parse the user command.
2. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
5. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.



Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("deletePerson 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `deletePerson 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeletePersonCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>



### Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

With reference to the diagram above, the `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences.
* stores a `PersonBook`, `LocationBook` and `VisitBook` for the three types of data (denoted by XYZ).
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList` of each type which can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.



The `Person`, `Location` and `Visit` components are shown in more detail below.

![Structure of Person and Location components](images/PersonLocationClassDiagram.png)
![Structure of the Visit component](images/VisitClassDiagram.png)



### Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

With reference to the diagram above, the `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the person book data in json format and read it back.
* can save the location book data in json format and read it back.
* can save the visit book data in json format and read it back.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** 
    Not all sections below will have a UML sequence/activity diagram. These diagrams serve to highlight the behaviours of the feature being discussed in the section.
    Should a diagram be omitted, the reader may assume that it has similar behaviour to similar features. 
    For example, the diagrams for `addLocation` and `addVisit` would be similar to `addPerson` hence only the `addPerson` section would have the diagrams. 
</div>

### Manage Persons, Locations and Visits using Unique Identifiers (Ho Pin Xian)

VirusTracker provides users with two ways to uniquely refer to an object, indexes and Ids.
This guide collectively refers to Ids and indexes as unique identifiers.
Indexes refer to the position of a person or location in the shown list.
An example of indexes and Ids can be seen in the image below. <br>

![personPanel](images/personPanel.PNG) 

Alex Yeoh is the first person on the persons list. He has an index of 1 and Id of S123A.
Bernice Yu is the second person. She has an index of 2 and Id of S234B.

The index of a person may change depending on the order of the list. For instance, the person with Index 1 will not be Alex
if the list only shows infected people. Hence, we have decided to add in Ids as a way to uniquely identify people and locations.
While indexes are short and easy to type, Ids have an advantage where the Id of each person and location
do not change. In addition, users do not need to scroll the list to find the Id of a particular person. 

VirusTracker has many functionalities that require the user to identify a specific person or location. These functions can
range from simple add, delete functions to functions involving the generating the list of people in contact with a specific person.
To allow the smooth extension of using either indexes or Ids in these commands, an IndexIdPair is used as an intermediate
to store the information used to identify person or location.

An example of how VirusTracker makes use of Unique Identifiers will be shown in the following Edit Person command example.



#### Editing Person using Unique Identifiers

Users may edit a Person inside VirusTracker.
In this example, VirusTracker can identify the Person to be edited using either index or Id via the use of the IndexIdPair.
Specific details about the details to update the person with are omitted for brevity.

#### Sequence diagram

The sequence diagram below shows how the editing operation works.

![DeletePersonUniqueIdentifierSequenceDiagram](images/EditPersonUniqueIdentifierSequenceDiagram.png)



#### Activity diagram

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when VirusTracker executes the command to edit a person.

![DeletePersonUniqueIdentifiersActivityDiagram](images/EditPersonUniqueIdentifiersActivityDiagram.png)



#### Design consideration

The design considerations below highlight alternative solutions to implementing Unique Identifiers
and provides reasons for the choice of implementation.

##### Aspect: User Input Ids Vs VirusTracker Created Ids
  
* **Alternative 1:** User Input Ids.
  * User inputs Unique Identifier during creation of Person and Location objects.
 
* **Alternative 2:** VirusTracker Created Ids.
  * VirusTracker creates a Unique Identifier for each Person and Location object upon creation.

For this aspect, we choose to make use of Ids provided by the user as opposed to VirusTracker-created Ids.
      
**Rationale**

The target audience of VirusTracker are healthcare officials in charge of managing the response to an infectious pandemic. 
It would thus be reasonable to assume that they have access to the Ids given by the State to each Person.
In Singapore's context, this would refer to the NRIC number. Similarly, the same would go for Locations.

VirusTracker overloads functions to take in Ids instead of indexes as input when referring to Locations and Persons.
The benefit of using Ids over indexes is that users do not have to scroll the list to find the Index of the
Person/Location they wish to refer to. We expect that a user whom wants to generate data involving an object, would
already be aware of the state given Id of the object. 

If VirusTracker creates the Id, this benefit would be lost since users will need to find the Id provided by the VirusTracker. 



### Deleting Visits using a specific date (Shu long)
This feature allows the VirusTracker to delete the outdated visit histories easily from the visit book as certain visit 
records will not contribute to contact tracing and generating the potential list for quarantine. The rationale is that 
the visits record before a time mark, for example 2 months ago, may not help to trace the recent list of contact 
for the new infected cases. Also, considering the number of visits made by all citizens in total, the data file size will be 
unnecessarily large, which not only makes the visit list harder to read, but also for the app slower to process with
the data. Hence, implementing this feature is necessary which enables the user to be more flexible in handling the data by 
removing the outdated visits record from the data.

**Format:** `deleteVisits d/Date`

#### Implementation

* Date is the targeted date set as the benchmark, all the visits that occur before and on the date itself will be deleted from the visit list.

#### Sequence diagram
The sequence diagram below shows how the deleteVisits operation works. Certain utility classes have been omitted for readability.

![DeleteVisitsSequenceDiagram](images/DeleteVisitsSequenceDiagram.png)



The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the `deleteVisits d/Date` command.

![DeleteVisitsActivityDiagram](images/DeleteVisitsActivityDiagram.png)



#### Design consideration

The design considerations below highlight alternative ways to delete Visits from the visit list

##### Aspect: Deleting visits using person and location vs using date

* **Alternative 1:** User delete Visits using a specific person or location.
  * All the visit records involving the specific person or the location will be deleted 

* **Alternative 2:** User delete Visits using a specific date.
  * All the visit records before and up to the date will be deleted 
  
For this aspect, we choose to use the second alternative using the specific date 

**Rationale**

The use of the visit records data is to assist contact tracing if an infected case is reported and the relevant information
such as the list of potential infected and infected places could then be generated by comparing the visits records of the infected with
other people's visit record. However, as the infected patients are only able to transmit the virus within a certain time frame,
e.g. two weeks or more, the visit records in the far past may not be helpful for generating the useful information.

Deleting by date allows the user to easily get rid of the outdated visit records data. In comparison, deleting by person and location serve
less of such purposes. It is only helpful when the location or the person information turns out to be invalid and hence
need to be removed. This implementation can be merged into the execution of deleting location or deleting person command.
Also, deleting by location and person tend to be much slower compared to using dates, especially when the number of people 
and locations are large.



### Manage data using CSV files (Siang Ern)

Most data collected by the target user group are likely to be in the form of Excel documents. As such, it is necessary for VirusTracker to include features to import and export data in a way that is compatible with Excel.

The features are facilitated by the `addFromCsv` and `exportToCsv` commands. They allow VirusTracker to manage data using **Comma-separated values** files which could also be handled by Excel.

#### Importing data from a CSV file

This feature essentially acts as a "bulk add" operation. The number of rows in the CSV file corresponds to the **maximum** number of objects that could be added to VirusTracker.

**Format:** `addFromCsv FILEPATH l/LIST_TYPE`

* `FILEPATH` refers to the absolute path that the file would be located at.
* `LIST_TYPE` is the data type that the user is attempting to add. The `addFromCsv` command supports three list types:
    1. people
    2. locations
    3. visits
* Each row in the specified CSV file must follow the format for the add command of the respective type. To find out about the format, you may click the relevant list type above.



An example of a CSV file that is used to add people is shown below. Notice that column G is not completely filled as the field is optional.

![SamplePersonCsv](images/ExamplePersonCsv.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The number of columns in the CSV file should correspond to the number of parameters required to create the related object. Information on additional columns **will be disregarded**.

</div>



#### Sequence diagram

The sequence diagram below shows how the adding operation works. Certain utility classes have been omitted for readability.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** Lifelines should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

![AddFromCsvCommandSequenceDiagram](images/AddFromCsvSequenceDiagram.png)


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** `XYZ` in the above sequence diagram can be used to denote either Persons, Locations or Visits.
For example, `generateXYZList` could be `generatePersonsList`, `generateLocationsList` or `generateVisitsList`. The behaviour of the three different entities are the same as the above sequence diagram.

</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** `listType` determines the type of entity to be used for `XYZ`. It may be Person, Location or Visit.

</div>



The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the `addFromCsv` command.

![AddFromCsvActivityDiagram](images/AddFromCsvActivityDiagram.png)



#### Design consideration

The design considerations below highlight alternative ways the command could have been implemented, and provides reasons for the choice of implementation.

##### Aspect: How are exceptions handled

For this aspect, we make a distinction between fatal exceptions and non-fatal exceptions.

* Fatal exceptions
  * Exceptions that cause the command to be unable to execute further.
  * These exceptions include but are not limited to: _missing parameters in CSV file_, _invalid file path, etc._    

* Non-fatal exceptions
  * The command could still continue executing even if this exception occured.
  * For example, _duplicate objects in the CSV file._
  * They tend to occur on a row by row basis in the CSV file.
  
* **Alternative 1:** Stop execution of command only for destructive exceptions.
  * Pros: User does not need to rerun the command for every exception that occurs.
  * Cons: Allowing certain exceptions to pass through may result in some bugs further down the line.

* **Alternative 2:** Stop execution for every exception that occurs.
  * Pros: Ensures correctness of the added objects.
  * Cons: May lead to worse user experience having to constantly rerun the command.



**Implementation**
 
Alternative 1 was chosen as the implementation with considerations from alternative 2.
* Upon encountering:
  * Fatal exception
    * The command stops execution and informs the user of the error.
  * Non-fatal exception
    * The command continues executing.
    * The rows where the exception occurs are recorded.
    * Upon finishing execution, the user is informed of the success and notified of the erroneous rows.
    
**Rationale**

As this command handles data from CSV files, it is likely the CSV files would be large (containing more than 10,000 rows).
  * Time taken for the `addFromCsv` command to execute is significant.
  
As such, the above implementation helps to reduce the need to read the large file repeatedly. 
  * User can fix the erroneous rows on a new CSV file.
  * Execution of the command would be faster than if the same large file was executed again.

This would minimise the impact to user experience as the user would spend less time fixing the errors.



##### Aspect: Absolute file path

The file path the command uses is the absolute path.
* The absolute path provides the complete details to locate the CSV file.
* Helps to avoid navigation errors that may result from using relative path names.

By allowing the user to specify the path name, it also gives the user a choice on where to put his CSV files instead of enforcing a particular directory for
him to store the files.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** While it is recommended for the user to use absolute file paths, there is nothing enforcing the user to do so. In the case when the user specfies a relative path,
VirusTracker would still attempt to locate the path, starting from the directory that the application is placed in. However, it is still required that the file path provided be valid.

</div>

##### Aspect: Reusing list types and the list prefix 'l/'

**Concern**: The list types are used for the `list` command, which appear to be unrelated to the `addFromCsv` command.

**Rationale**

This command handles people, locations and visits which corresponded to the list types already implemented for use for the list command.

By using a format similar to the `list` command, it avoids the need for implementing a possible **data type** parameter which would not have a
significant difference from list type.

Furthermore, it allows the user to use a format that they are already comfortable with.



### List high risk locations of infection (Wu Qirui)
This feature allows the VirusTracker to display a list high risk location of infection. This list of high risk location 
of infection is generated using data currently stored in VirusTracker. The data include the infection status of all 
people, all visits that are made by infected people and all locations. 

**Format:** `list [HIGH_RISK_LOCATION_NUMBER] l/high-risk-locations`
* `HIGH_RISK_LOCATION_NUMBER` refers to how many top most infected locations that will be displayed in the GUI.

#### Implementation
This feature is one of the different `list` commands. It has the same command word as other `list` commands, which is 
`list`. The `LIST_TYPE` of this command is `high-risk-location`.

* Infected person is defined as person with infection status as `true`
* Infected visit is defined as visit made by any infected person
* Infected location is defined as location that has been visited by any infected person
* If user specifies number of high risk locations in the command, then number of high risk locations would be the user 
specified value.
* If user does not specifies number of high risk locations, then number of high risk location of infection is 
determined using the following rule:    
    * If number of infected location is larger than 60% of total number of locations, then the number of high risk 
location is `40% * (number of total locations)`.  
    * Else, number of high risk location is the number of infected location.
      
  Below shows two examples of how the number of high risk locations is calculated when user does not specify a value
  for it.
  
  Example 1 (number of infected locations is larger than 60% total number of locations):
  ```
  total number of locations: 100
  number of infected locations: 72
  
  // 72 is larger than 60 which is 60% of total number of locations 
  72 > 60 = 100 * 60% -> number of high risk locations = 100 * 40% = 40
  
  // The top most 40 infected locations will be displayed as high risk locations
  ```
  
  
  
  Example 2 (number of infected locations is smaller than 60% of total number of locations):
  ```
  total number of locations: 100
  number of infected locations: 23
    
  // 23 is smaller than 60 which is 60% of total number of locations 
  23 < 60 = 100 * 60% -> number of high risk locations = number of infected locations = 23
    
  // The top most 23 infected locations will be displayed as high risk locations (i.e. all 
  infected locations are high risk locations)
  ```

##### Implementation detail
1. When this command is executed, a list of all infected people is obtained.
2. A list of all visits made by all infected people is obtained using the list of infected people.
3. Use a `HashMap` to store the location as the key and the number of visits made by any infected person to this 
location as the value. Generate this `HashMap` from the list of visits in step 2.
4. Sort the `HashMap` in Step 3 from most infected visits to least infected visits.
5. Obtain the number of high risk locaiton `n` from user specified value or calculation using the pre-defined rule 
stated above.
6. Display the top `n` locations of the sorted infected location list as the list of high risk locations.



#### Sequence diagram
The sequence diagram below shows an example of how the command of listing high risk locations with no user input works.
Certain utility classes and certain parameters of some methods have been omitted for readability.

![ListHighRiskLocationNoUserInputSequenceDiagram](images/ListHighRiskLocationNoUserInputSequenceDiagram.png)

The sequence diagram below shows an example of how the command of listing high risk locations with user input of `3`
works. Certain utility classes and certain parameters of some methods have been omitted for readability.

![ListHighRiskLocationHaveUserInputSequenceDiagram](images/ListHighRiskLocationHaveUserInputSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the `list l/high-risk-locations` command.

![ListHighRiskLocationActivityDiagram](images/ListHighRiskLocationActivityDiagram.png)



#### Design consideration

##### Aspect: User input for number of high risk locations

The parameter for list high risk locations command is optional. Users can choose to or choose not to input the number of
high risk locations for this command. 

**Rationale**

Instead of always using the pre-defined rule within VirusTracker, this implementation allows users to customize the
number of high risk locations displayed in VirusTracker. If the pre-defined rule is in use, users might not be able to 
view more infected locations beyond the displayed high risk locations that are selected automatically by VirusTracker.

##### Aspect: Determining number of high risk locations for infection when user does not specify the number

In the case where user does not specify the number of high risk locations in the command, the system itself will
determine the number of high risk locations using the following rule:

* If number of infected location is larger than 60% of number of total number of location, then the number of high risk 
location is `40% * (number of total locations)`.  The number `40%` is an appropriate number as not too many nor too few
infected locations will be displayed.

* Else, number of high risk location is the number of infected location. Since less than 40% of total locations are 
infected, all infected locations can be considered as high risk because they are the only few locations that are 
infected.

**Rationale**

This rule can ensure that not too few infected locations are displayed especially when the number of total infected
locations are low because all infected locations will be displayed when all infected locations are less that 40% of 
total locations. 

This rule can also ensure that not too many infected locations are displayed especially when the 
number of total infected locations are high because only the top most 40% of infected locations will be display when 
total infected locations are more 60% of total infected locations.



### Delete Locations (Wu Qirui)
This feature allows VirusTracker to delete a certain location from the location book inside VirusTracker. When a 
location is no longer needed in VirusTracker, user can delete the particular location using `deleteLocation` command.
One important thing to note is when deleting a location from VirusTracker, all visits associated with this location 
would also be deleted from the visit book inside VirusTracker. The action of deleting a location is irreversible.

**Format:** `deleteLocation LOCATION_IDENTIFIER`

* `LOCATION_IDENTIFIER` refers to the index of the location displayed on the list in the GUI or unique identifier of
the location.

#### Sequence diagram
The sequence diagram below shows an example of how the command of deleting a location using the index on displayed
list works. Certain utility classes and certain parameters of some methods have been omitted for readability.

The sequence diagram below shows an example of how the command of deleting a location using the unique identifier of 
the location works. Certain utility classes and certain parameters of some methods have been omitted for readability.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the `deleteLocation` command.

![DeleteLocationActivityDiagram](images/DeleteLocationActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design consideration
The design considerations below highlight alternative ways the command could have been implemented, and provides reasons
for the choice of implementation.

##### Aspect: How to identify the location to be deleted
* **Alternative 1:** Identify the location using index displayed in the GUI.
  * Pros: Allows users to delete the location they see on the list.
  * Cons: If there are many locations, users may need to spend a lot of time to look for the location and its index.
 
* **Alternative 2:** Identify the location using unique location id.
  * Pros: Save time for looking through the list to find the location and its index.
  * Cons: Need to know the unique id of the location which users might not remember.

**Implementation**

A combination of Alternative 1 and Alternative 2 is used as the implementation.
Users are allowed to input either the index of location shown on the list in the GUI or the unique location id with 
prefix `idl/` in front of the unique location id. If users input both index and unique location id, index will take 
precedence over unique location id (i.e. the location to be deleted is retrieved using index without checking any
location with the inputted unique location id).

**Rationale**

This implementation allow more flexibility and convenience for users to delete locations they want. It combines strength
of both Alternatives.

#### Aspect: Update visit book after deleting a location

* **Alternative 1:** Keep a copy of original location and a copy of edited location. Iterate through the list of visits
and compare the location of each visit in the list with the original location. If there is a match, then replace the
location in the visit with the edited location.

* **Alternative 2:** Keep a copy of edited location only. Iterate through the list of visits and compare the
unique id of location of each visit in the list with the unique id of the edited location. If there is a match, then
replace the location in the visit with the edited location.

**Implementation**

Alternative 1 was chose as the implementation with consideration from Alternative 2. A copy of Location object is used
to identify the same location in the visits list. To check whether both locations are the same, the unique id of the 
location is used along with the name and address of the location.

**Rationale**

This implementation can improve the robustness of the code for more accurate checks for identical locations. This 
implementation can also reduce lines of code to improve readability.

### GUI Functionality for displaying lists of people, locations and visits (Koh Han Ming)

VirusTracker manages lists of person, location and visit objects. Accordingly, it needs to be able to display the information stored in these objects in a meaningful way. As the lists can be updated, the information displayed must also be changed.
These changes will be reflected on the GUI every time a list is updated. 

#### Implementation
The lists are updated when the user inputs one of the following commands:

1. Adding data: `add`
2. Deleting data: `delete`
3. Editing data: `edit`
4. Finding data: `find`
5. Listing data: `list`
6. Generating people in contact with an infected person: `generatePeople`
7. Generating locations an infected person has been to: `generateLocations`

#### Sequence diagram
The sequence diagram below shows how the GUI updates using the list all people command as an example: `list l/people`

![DisplayListOfAllPeopleSequenceDiagram](images/DisplayListOfAllPeopleSequenceDiagram.png)



#### Activity diagram
The activity diagram below shows how the GUI updates using the list all people command as an example: `list l/people`

![DisplayListOfAllPeopleActivityDiagram](images/DisplayListOfAllPeopleActivityDiagram.png)



#### Design consideration

These considerations take a look at different variations of how the GUI could have been implemented, and why the final version was chosen.

##### Aspect: Ease of viewing

The primary concern with the GUI was how the layout of the lists of people, locations and visits affected the readability of information.
  
* **Alternative 1:** All lists are viewed on the same screen.
  * Pros: User will be able to see every single type of information at a glance.
  * Cons: Each list takes up a smaller section of the screen, it hard to read each individual person, location or visit

* **Alternative 2:** Each list has its own screen and the user will switch between them when necessary.
  * Pros: No clutter of UI elements.
  * Cons: Referencing other lists becomes troublesome.



**Implementation**
 
Alternative 1 was chosen as the implementation and included considerations from alternative 2 as well.
* All lists are viewed on the same screen.
* Size of each list on screen provides enough space to display all information about people, locations and visits adequately.
* Default screen size was also increased to prevent any list from getting clipped at the edges.
    
**Rationale**

Some commands require references to multiple lists. For example, addVisit uses the indexes from the people and location lists. If each list is given individual screens, the user has 2 options:
  * User must remember the indexes to be used.
  * User will have to switch screens to view people and locations before being able to enter the addVisit command.

Hence, it made more sense to have all 3 lists and their information always readily available to the user.

## **Appendix: Instructions for manual testing**

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on;
testers are expected to do more *exploratory* testing.

</div>

### Launch and shutdown

1. Initial launch

   1. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder

   1. Double-click the jar file Expected: Shows the GUI with a set of sample person, location and visit data.

1. Saving window preferences

   1. Resize the window to an optimum size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window.

   1. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file.<br>
       Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.



### Deleting a person

1. Deleting a person while all persons are being shown

   1. Prerequisites: List all persons using the `list l/people` command. Multiple persons in the list.

   1. Test case: `deletePerson 1`<br>
      Expected: First contact is deleted from the list. Details of the deleted contact shown in the status message.

   1. Test case: `deletePerson 0`<br>
      Expected: No person is deleted. Error details shown in the status message.

   1. Other incorrect deletePerson commands to try: `deletePerson`, `deletePerson x`, `...` (where x is larger than the list size)<br>


## **Appendix: Effort**

1. Creating VirusTracker has an extraordinary high level of difficulty. VirusTracker unlike most other applications is 
   managing three different types of objects at once (persons, locations and visits). These objects are interlinked
   which makes ensuring the correctness of VirusTracker even tougher. A lot of effort was required to make an effective
   and correct design. Many challenges were faced and thousands of lines of code are added to reach the quality that
   VirusTracker has now.
